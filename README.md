# ✨ Thrisha Rajkumar
*MSc Data Science @ University of Bristol (Russell Group, 2025) | AI/ML Research Support – NIHR-funded NHS Stroke Rehab | Ex-Unilever Data Science Intern | Building production ML pipelines with real-world impact*

Data Scientist & ML Engineer specializing in **end-to-end, cloud-native ML systems**: data pipelines, feature engineering, orchestration (Airflow), deployment, monitoring, drift detection, and governance. Hands-on across healthcare (clinical AI, explainable models), industrial optimization, and commercial analytics — using predictive modelling, time-series, NLP, deep learning, generative AI, and XAI (SHAP/LIME).  
**Tech stack**: Python, SQL, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Airflow, Azure/AWS, Docker, CI/CD, Flutter integration. Delivering scalable, interpretable, GDPR-compliant solutions with measurable outcomes (e.g., 40% process efficiency gains, 12–15% energy reduction).  

UK Graduate Visa eligible | London-based | Open to hybrid/remote roles in Data Science, ML/AI Engineering, MLOps.

## 👋 About Me
Passionate about **AI for social good** — currently developing production-grade AI for NHS stroke rehabilitation (personalized exercise recommendations via LLMs, generative models, and user-centered co-design).  
Bridging ML research, software engineering, and clinical impact. Ex-Unilever intern with cross-functional analytics delivering operational wins.

## 🎓 Education
- **MSc Data Science** – University of Bristol (2024–2025) — Distinction track (focus: AI, NLP, Bayesian methods, visual analytics)
- **BTech Computer Science Engineering** – DIT University (2020–2024) — First Class Honours (85.4%, top cohort)

## 💼 Key Experience
- **AI/ML Research Support & Software Engineer** – NIHR Stroke Rehabilitation Project, University of Bristol (2025–present)  
  End-to-end development of AI-powered cross-platform app: predictive personalization, Clinical-T5 NLP, diffusion/generative models, SHAP/LIME explainability, Airflow pipelines, Azure/AWS deployment, drift monitoring. Co-designed with patients & clinicians; lead author on accepted HEALTHINF 2025 paper (Barcelona).

- **Data Science & Analytics Intern** – Unilever (Hindustan Unilever Ltd., 2024)  
  14+ projects in supply chain, manufacturing, safety: Python optimization for 250+ SKUs (40% changeover reduction), ML anomaly detection, forecasting (15–20% efficiency gains), energy dashboards (12–15% usage cut), Tableau/Power BI.

- Other: Sapienza University research (neural nets for protein prediction), Salesforce/Infosys internships (RPA, NLP), Flutter full-stack projects.

## 📄 Publications
- **Lead Author**: “Personalised Stroke Rehabilitation: An AI Pipeline for Exercise Programmes Using a Co-Designed Decision Support Tablet Application” — HEALTHINF 2025 (peer-reviewed, NIHR-backed).

## 📊 Featured Projects
🔹 **NHS Stroke Rehab AI App** — Flutter + ML personalization, clinician/patient co-design, production deployment.  
🔹 **EMI Surrogate Modelling** — Physics-informed neural nets, multi-head attention, R² >0.95, SHAP analysis (thesis work).  
🔹 **UK Census Visual Analytics** — Bayesian imputation, UMAP/t-SNE/KMeans, interactive Tableau dashboards for socio-economic insights.  
🔹 **Peri-Operative Time-Series Forecasting** — LSTMs/CNNs/Transformers on INSPIRE dataset (distributed GPU scaling).  
🔹 **Protein Residue Prediction (Sapienza)** — CIRNet + feature engineering → 78% accuracy boost.
